# Project 1<br>BlackJack

##Overview
Blackjack is a card game where the player and the dealer compete to get a sum of cards to 21 without going over 21. If you go over the sum of 21, you will be considered bust and lose the round. The player and dealer will be delt two cards at the start of the round. One of the cards for the dealer will be facedown and the value is hidden from the player.

2:  Once the round has started, the player has two options. Option 1 is to "hit", which will give a player an additional card. The sum of the player's cards will automatically be added together. The player has the option of recieving more cards as long as the sum is under 21. Option 2 is "stand", which will keep the total amount of cards and move to the dealers turn.

3: Once it is the dealers turn, the hidden card will be revealed. The dealer has special house rules. If the sum of the dealer's cards is less than 17, the dealer will need to add another card. This will be repeated until the dealer has a sum of 17 or higher.

4: After the dealers turn, the sums of both the dealer and the player will be compared to determine a winner.
